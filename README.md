# InstaStory-Viewers

Simple webscraper using selenium to extract a list of your Instagram story viewers. (Will probably retry this using the api lol)

Steps:

1. Ensure the modules selenium and requests are installed, else use pip install to do so.
2. Download the chromedriver for your chrome version through https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. (Check chrome version through;
    Top Right menu -> Help -> About Google Chrome
3. Extract the chromedriver.exe and set its path in main.py
4. You might be required to set the chromedriver path in PATH variables as well.
5. Adjust sleep times accordingly if issues arise.
6. Data will contain the list of viewers at that time of your first active story. Do what you will with this information :)
